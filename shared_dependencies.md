1. Django Framework: All the files share the Django framework as a dependency. Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites.

2. User Model: The "users/models.py" file will define the User model, which will be used across the application for authentication and authorization. This model will be shared by all other models, views, and templates that require user information.

3. URL Patterns: The "urls.py" files in each app (production, quality, warehouse, users) will define URL patterns that are used across the application. These patterns will be included in the main "erp_system/urls.py" file.

4. Views: The "views.py" files in each app will define views that are used across the application. These views will be shared by the corresponding templates and URL patterns.

5. Forms: The "forms.py" files in each app will define forms that are used across the application. These forms will be shared by the corresponding views and templates.

6. Templates: The "base.html" template will be extended by all other HTML templates in the application. It will include common elements like the header, footer, and navigation bar.

7. Static Files: The "main.css" and "main.js" files in the "static" directory will be used across the application. They will include common styles and JavaScript functions.

8. Middleware: The "middleware.py" file will define middleware classes that are used across the application. These classes will be shared by all views.

9. Test Cases: The "tests.py" file will define test cases that are used across the application. These test cases will be shared by all models and views.

10. Admin Interface: The "admin.py" file will define the admin interface for the application. This interface will be shared by all models.

11. Migrations: The "migrations" directory will contain migration files that are used across the application. These files will be shared by all models.

12. DOM Elements: The id names of DOM elements used in JavaScript functions will be shared across the corresponding HTML templates and JavaScript files.

13. Message Names: The names of messages used in the application will be shared across all views and templates.

14. Function Names: The names of functions defined in the views, forms, and models will be shared across the application.
